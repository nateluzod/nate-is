      <h1>HTTPS Redirect for Laravel on Heroku</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 27, 2017</span>
      <p>Earlier this week I had a series of &lsquo;black-hole&rsquo; days; the kind where you spend way too long on one problem, only to end the day with embarrassingly little to show for it.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I started writing is to document fixes for those odd issues and hopefully prevent others from having to deal with the same things. Tuesday&rsquo;s issue was forwarding all non http requests to https on a Laravel app.</p>

<p>Seems simple enough, right? Sadly, no.</p>

<p>First off, I tried a few simple .htaccess variations, all of which returned &lsquo;Too many redirects&rsquo;. No problem, there were other options. Next, I tried a few different middleware approaches. Worked fine locally, virtually ineffective on the server. After that, I tried using \URL::forceSchema(&lsquo;https&rsquo;); in AppServiceProvider.php - also totally ineffective. By this point I had burned a couple hours. Submitted a ticket to Heroku support and kept looking. I can&rsquo;t remember how or which SO thread(s) this was pieced together from, but this did the trick:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_negotiation.c&gt;
    Options -MultiViews
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm

    RewriteEngine On

    #Normal way (in case you need to deploy to NON-heroku)
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on

    #Heroku way
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https

    #If neither above conditions are met, redirect to https
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

    # Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

    # Handle Front Controller...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]

    # Handle Authorization Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The response I got from Heroku the next day more or less explains why middleware didn&rsquo;t do anything:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heroku dynos run behind a routing layer that handles load balancing and HTTPS termination (<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#routing">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#routing</a>), so the request to the backend is plain HTTP, and the original protocol of the request is in the X-Forwarded-Proto header, as documented here: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#heroku-headers">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#heroku-headers</a></p>

<p>You need to rewrite based on that header, or, if you want to handle things purely in Laravel, instruct the framework to trust the right headers, as documented here: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-laravel#trusting-the-load-balancer&quot;">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-laravel#trusting-the-load-balancer&quot;</a></p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s that. Hopefully, if you&rsquo;re suffering the same issue, Google will be kind and lead you here.</p>
