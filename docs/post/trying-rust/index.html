      <h1>Trying Rust</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 28, 2017</span>
      <p>I hit a wall working on CMS / WordPress this afternoon so decided to take a few minutes to check out a &lsquo;new&rsquo; language. Never mind that I&rsquo;m months behind on learning Elixir, Phoenix and Elm, as was my plan for earlier this year - today I wanted to check out Rust.</p>

<p>Why? I&rsquo;m not terribly interested in building anything non-web, so Rust falls decidedly out of my sweet spot in terms of practicality. There are a handful of frameworks but nothing close to resembling an easy path if you&rsquo;d want to comfortably move forward with client work.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I just wanted to expose myself to something different.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t study computer science, have no background in C or C++ and my only C-based language knowledge comes from years of PHP development. With that said, the syntax seemed familiar enough. A few things I noticed off the bat:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cargo is nice. There&rsquo;s nothing to hate about JSON but Cargo.toml is so much easier on the eyes than package or composer.json, and <code>cargo</code> runs fast.</li>
<li>Variables are immutable by default, you have to explicitly add mut for mutability. I&rsquo;m sure this exists elsewhere but it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve personally seen it.</li>
<li>Values are statically typed, but the compiler will attempt to infer based on use.</li>
<li>Control flow / loops have interesting things like a <code>.rev()</code> method. Again, I&rsquo;m sure it exists elsewhere but it&rsquo;s a first for me.</li>
<li>Rust devs are referred to as &lsquo;rustaceans&rsquo;
I like that the docs immediately dive into building something you can interact with. I created a guessing game command line app pretty quickly, and it worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rust looks cool and I have to assume that the high praise lavished on the language by so many talented devs is well-deserved. For me and my needs, though, I probably won&rsquo;t spend any more time looking into it anytime soon. Low level memory management is too far outside my immediate concerns.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Elixir immediately, and Phoenix and its ecosystem makes it a more pragmatic focus for the foreseeable future.</p>
