 ('5', '5', 'en_us', 'About', '<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span> have been building on the web for nearly two decades. Aside from the random odd-jobs you end up doing before and during college, developing sites and designing is the only profession I\'ve ever known, and I\'m content to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Technology\'s constant evolution has kept me fascinated, and despite being something of a geezer by web standards I feel the same excitement today, opening up Atom and digging into a MVC app, that I did opening up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Composer\">Netscape Composer</a> and cobbling together my first table-based HTML page back in 1998.</p>\n<p>I\'ve served in roles as disparate as art director at a lean startup to front end dev in an enterprise Java firm. I ran a one-man shop out of my mom\'s den, doing branding for multimillion-dollar enterprises, and I founded my own multimillion-dollar company that grew to thirty employees in three offices nationwide. But ownership wasn\'t for me. I\'m happiest when I\'m producing and as I came to learn: when you own a company very little time is spent doing things other than owning a company. </p>\n<p>Today I\'m proud to work for <a href=\"http://atlanticmediastrategies.com\">Atlantic Media Strategies</a>, where we solve problems for some of the world\'s leading nonprofits and public institutions. Even better is that they trust me to report to Washington DC from my adopted home, Honolulu. Remote collaboration suits my working style, which requires long stretches of uninterrupted, focused time. With the miracles of Slack, Github, Google Hangouts, assorted project management tools and a mountain of elbow grease, we\'ve pulled off some amazing projects. We even have the awards to prove it.  </p>\n<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\n<p>CRUD apps and CMS platforms are becoming commoditized, so I find myself motivated, by curiosity and pragmatism, to continue to branch out. Areas of interest are machine learning and functional programming. For the first part of 2017 I\'ll be focusing on Erlang, subsequently Elixir, and hopefully building my first app in Phoenix. There are Clojure and Haskell books stacking up on my desk once that\'s done.</p>\n<h2>Evenings &amp; Weekends</h2>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">O</span>utside of work, I spend as much time as possible outdoors. This usually ends up as some combination of hiking, climbing, blazing trails, backpacking or camping and usually with some combination of my wife and dog.</p>\n<p>I have been a hobby photographer since 2007 and as of 2016 I have sold all my digital gear to start <a href=\"{entry:28:url}\">shooting film</a>. Check out some of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nateluzod\">my work</a> if you\'re interested.</p>\n<p>Time and finances permitting, I travel as much as I can. I\'ve been to places as far flung as Iceland, New Zealand, Tibet and New Jersey. On the shortlist are Kilimanjaro and Patagonia, which should round out all continents, Antarctica notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>Alright, that\'s all I\'ve got for now. If you want to find out more you can follow me using one of the links in the footer or send me an <a href=\"mailto:nate.luzod@gmail.com\">old fashioned email</a>. </p>\n<h3>About this Site</h3>\n<p>I built this site using a Pro version of <a href=\"http://craftcms.com\">Craft CMS</a>.

 ('11', '11', 'en_us', 'Work', '<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span> have been building on the web for nearly two decades. Aside from the random, odd-jobs you end up doing before and during college, developing sites and designing is the only profession I\'ve ever really known, and I\'m content to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Technology\'s constant evolution has kept me fascinated, and despite being something of a geezer by web standards I feel the same excitement today, opening up Atom and digging into a MVC app, that I did opening up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Composer\">Netscape Composer</a> and cobbling together my first table-based HTML page back in 1998.</p>\n<p>I\'ve served in roles as disparate as art director at a lean startup to front end dev in an enterprise Java firm. I ran a one-man shop out of my mom\'s den, doing branding for multimillion-dollar enterprises, and I founded my own multimillion-dollar company that grew to thirty employees in three offices nationwide. But ownership wasn\'t for me. I\'m happiest when I\'m producing and as I came to learn: when you own a company very little time is spent doing things other than owning a company. </p>\n<p>Today I\'m proud to work for <a href=\"http://atlanticmediastrategies.com\">Atlantic Media Strategies</a>, where we solve problems for some of the world\'s leading nonprofits and public institutions. Even better is that they trust me to report to Washington DC from my adopted home, Honolulu. Remote collaboration suits my working style, which requires long stretches of uninterrupted, focused time. With the miracles of Slack, Github, Google Hangouts, assorted project management tools and a mountain of elbow grease, we\'ve pulled off some amazing projects. We even have the awards to prove it.  </p>\n<h2>Dev Experience</h2>\n<p>The bulk of my development experience is with PHP-based content management systems (<a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"http://expressionengine.com\">ExpressionEngine</a> and <a href=\"http://craftcms.com\">Craft</a>) and workflow apps built in Java, Python and Rails. </p>\n<p>While not the sexiest of platforms from a technical perspective, WordPress has been a strong focus for the past few years given it\'s 25% market share of the the internet. It was a practical choice and despite its reputation for spaghetti code under-the-hood, my team and I have found ways to bend and shape it to our needs while applying some architectural best-practices from our favorite frameworks. </p>\n<p>This site was built in Craft CMS which I quickly grew to love, and I\'ll recommend to anyone willing to deviate from the (relative) comfort of WordPress. </p>\n<p>As of 2016, I am building my first app in <a href=\"http://laravel.com\">Laravel</a> and enjoying almost every aspect of it. Despite having written it since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML\">DHTML</a> days, I maintain a love/hate relationship with JavaScript and struggle to find motivation to keep up with what seems like a framework fashion show. </p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>CRUD apps and CMS platforms are becoming commoditized, so I find myself motivated, by curiosity and pragmatism, to continue to branch out. Areas of interest are machine learning and functional programming. For the first part of 2017 I\'ll be spending evenings and weekends learning Erlang, subsequently Elixir, and hopefully building my first app in Phoenix. There are Clojure and Haskell books stacking up on my desk once that\'s done.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-02-21 09:55:21', '2017-02-26 02:36:41', 'c8933a90-f11f-43d6-8b01-a8979f350bb0'),
